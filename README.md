# Writing Accoutability Contract

## Preface

The above MS Word document was revised and used 24 times over six years (2016-2021) with a colleague at a different institution.
It is a form of writing accountability that operates daily during the work week. 
We would exchange e-mails at the end of the day to report our progress.
We would exchange contracts at the beginning of a contract period.

Other people meet on Zoom and write during the Zoom session.
We tried this once; my partner did not like it.

We had several multi-month breaks due to a sabbatical year and COVID infections.

Our contracts were limited to several months.
We used a Microsoft Word document because my partner did not use LaTeX.
Markdown, org-mode, and LaTeX versions are provided above.

It is too hard for most struggling writers to follow: It only works with the most committed writers.
Finding another like-minded person to serve as a writing partner (called the *Mentor* in the contract) is not easy.
I met my partner in a subscription-based academic writing club. 
I would consider making the contracts again if I found the right partner.

These contracts helped me finish more writing projects and practice the habits listed in the contract during writing sessions.
I continue to practice these habits during my writing sessions.

I decided to share the contract on GitHub to benefit others and to archive it.


## WRITER CONTRACT Number 24

This agreement starts August 1, 2021 (the “effective date”) and will end on October 1, 2021. The agreement is between ZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZ (Contractor) and XXXXX XXXXXXX (Mentor). The Contractor must do A-C each weekday while meeting conditions D-G. The goal is to make steady progress on two writing projects a day. This is hard, especially during a pandemic while serving as a core lab director, teaching, serving on a NIH study section, and serving on several internal and external committees. 

The Contractor is required to do the following writing tasks per day. The Contractor may do `windfall' writing outside of these writing blocks on the same or other projects. The designated blocks of time in A-B do not need to be adjacent.

A. Work on manuscript A1 for 90 minutes per day, M-F. Manuscript A1 is the most important and urgent manuscript. Its identity may change over the contract period. 

B. Work on one grant proposal for 90 minutes per day, M-F. The contractor has a R01 due October 5th and another due December 5th.

C. Generative writing for one book reaching a minimum of 1000 new words by Friday of each week. The contractor has a soft goal on adding 4000 words a month. The contractor will work on the book on the weekends. 

D. Qualifying text includes:
- Manuscripts, grant applications, books
-	editorial reviews of manuscripts and grant proposals
-	mind maps for planning manuscripts or grant applications
-	entries in writing logs

-	heavily edited or newly generated computer programs directly related to the project

-	entries in annotated bibliography
-	any other activity that advances the writing project

E. Confirm achievement of A and B by sending an email with “Done" on the subject line to the Mentor by 11:59 PM. Done on Friday’s means that the book writing is finished.

F. The contractor may not do the following during the writing blocks and will restart if any interruptions occur.
-	check e-mail
-	surf the web
-	listen to interview or news show videos on YouTube (music is okay if it is not distracting)
-	answer the phone
