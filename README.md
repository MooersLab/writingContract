# Writing Accoutability Contract

## The problem

Some (most) writers need some form of external structure to support the keeping of their daily writing schedule.

## The Solutions

1. One approach is to use an accountability mechanism of reporting one's progress to another person. 
This can be done via the means of reciprocal writing contracts with the other person.
This works best with two people who was closely matched in the strength of their daily writing habit. ***This site provides template contracts for the first approach.***

2. Another solution is to pay hundreds of dollars a year to participate in a on-line writing club where the members of a group hold each other accountable.
Most of the people who join such groups are stuggling with sticking to a schedule.
If you have a strong habit, this may not be for you.

3. A third solution is to form or join a writing group that meets briefly once a week to share their progress.
These groups are tricky to sustain.
Most people drop out after a few meetings.


## The details

The above MS Word document was revised and used 24 times over six years (2016-2021) with a colleague at a different institution.
The contract is a writing accountability tool that operates daily during the work week between two people: each persion is a Contractor and serves as the reciprocal Mentor for the other writer. 
We exchanged e-mails at the end of the day to report our progress.

We exchanged contracts at the beginning of a contract period.
Each person made their own contract with customized terms to support meeting their writing goals.
The above example has items A, B, and C. 
It was very challenging to sustain these three writing projects in parallel, but often we have no choice.
Item A would be sufficient for beginers how lack an daily established writing habit.

Some people meet on Zoom and write during their schedueld writing times.
This approach may be too stressful for some writing partners.

Our contracts were limited to several months.
We had several breaks due to a sabbatical year and COVID infections.
We used a Microsoft Word document.

Markdown, org-mode, and LaTeX versions are also provided above.
The PDF was compiled on Overleaf from the tex file.
The org-mode and markdown versions can be previewed on GitHub by clicking on the filename.

Org-mode is a variant of markdown on steriods.
It was designed to be used in Emacs but it can be used in other editors.
It has attracted many young people to Emacs in the past decade.

The keeping of the writing contract is too hard for most struggling writers: It only works with the most committed writers who need this kind of structure.
These contracts may appeal the most to the *pioneer* personality type of the [Five Voices](https://5voices.com/) personality classification system.

Finding another like-minded person to serve as a writing partner (called the *Mentor* in the contract) is not easy.
I met my partner in a subscription-based academic writing club.
I used the writing contracts as a substitute for my daily participation in the writing club and was able to terminate my subscription.
I would consider making the contracts again if I found the right partner.

These contracts helped me finish more writing projects and practice the habits listed in the contract during writing sessions.
The last year of the contracts (2021), I published 11 papers (5 senior author papers).
I continue to practice the habits listed in the contract during my writing sessions.
I decided to share the contract on GitHub to help others with the development of their daily writing habit.

## Zettelkastens

The contract template mentions [zettelkastens](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) (slip-boxes).
These are knowledge bases that may assest the development of new writing projects.
The paper version of the zettlekasten is akin to a card catalog of your knowledge.
Many electronic versions have been implemented in the past decade.
Some of them provide graphical views of your knowledge base that resembles an extended mindmap.

I think [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index) is the best option (i.e., intuitive to use, free, data stored locally).
Emacs users will probably want to be [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) because it is easier to capture entries on the fly than having to leave Emacs to use another application.
You can alway migrate your org-roam notes to Obsidian if org-roam get too hard to manage.


## The unmodified WRITER CONTRACT Number 24

This agreement starts August 1, 2021 (the 'effective date') and will end on October 1, 2021. The agreement is between ZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZ (Contractor) and XXXXX XXXXXXX (Mentor). The Contractor must do A-C each weekday while meeting conditions D-G. The goal is to make steady progress on two writing projects a day. This is hard, especially during a pandemic while serving as a core lab director, teaching, serving on a NIH study section, and serving on several internal and external committees. 

The Contractor is required to do the following writing tasks per day. The Contractor may do `windfall' writing outside of these writing blocks on the same or other projects. The designated blocks of time in A-B do not need to be adjacent.

A. Work on manuscript A1 for 90 minutes per day, M-F. Manuscript A1 is the most important and urgent manuscript. Its identity may change over the contract period. 

B. Work on one grant proposal for 90 minutes per day, M-F. The contractor has a R01 due October 5th and another due December 5th.

C. Generative writing for one book reaching a minimum of 1000 new words by Friday of each week. The contractor has a soft goal on adding 4000 words a month. The contractor will work on the book on the weekends. 

D. Qualifying text includes:
- Manuscripts, grant applications, books
-	editorial reviews of manuscripts and grant proposals
-	mind maps for planning manuscripts or grant applications
-	entries in writing logs

-	heavily edited or newly generated scripts for making figures for the writing document
-	heavily edited or newly generated computer programs directly related to the project

-	entries in annotated bibliography
-	any other activity that advances the writing project

E. Confirm achievement of A and B by sending an email with “Done" on the subject line to the Mentor by 11:59 PM. Done on Friday’s means that the book writing is finished.

F. The contractor may not do the following during the writing blocks and will restart if any interruptions occur.
-	check e-mail
-	surf the web
-	listen to interview or news show videos on YouTube (music is okay if it is not distracting)
-	answer the phone
