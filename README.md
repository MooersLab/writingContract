# Template Writing Accoutability Contract

The above MS Word document was revised and used 24 times over a six year period (2016-2021) with a collegue at a different institution.
It is a form of writing accountability that operates on a daily basis during the work week. 
We would exchange e-mails at the end the day to report our progress.

Other people meet on Zoom and write during the Zoom session.
We tried this once; my parnter did not like it.

We had several multi-months breaks due to a sabbatical year and COVID infections.

Our contracts were limited to several months.
We used a MS Word document becuase my partner did not use LaTeX.

It is too hard for most struggling writers to follow: It only works with the most committed writers.
It is not easy to find another like-minded person to serve of a writing partner (called the *Mentor* in the contract).
I would consider doing it again if I found the right partner.

I think that these contracts helped me finish more writing projects.
I decided to share it on GitHub to benefit others and to archive it.


## WRITER CONTRACT 24

The Contractor must do A-C each weekday while meeting conditions D-G. The goal is to make steady progress on two writing projects a day.
