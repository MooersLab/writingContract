\section{WRITER CONTRACT Number 24}\label{writer-contract-number-24}}

This agreement starts August 1, 2021 (the ``effective date'') and will
end on October 1, 2021. The agreement is between ZZZZZ ZZZZZZ
(Contractor) and XXXXX XXXXXXX (Mentor). T he Contractor must do A-C
each weekday while meeting conditions D-G. The goal is to make steady
progress on two writing projects a day. This is hard, especially during
a pandemic while serving as a core lab director, teaching, serving on a
NIH study section, and serving on several internal and external
committees.

The Contractor is required to do the following writing tasks per day.
The Contractor may do `windfall' writing outside of these writing blocks
on the same or other projects. The designated blocks of time in A-B do
not need to be adjacent.

A. Work on manuscript A1 for 90 minutes per day, M-F. Manuscript A1 is
the most important and urgent manuscript. Its identity may change over
the contract period.

B. Work on one grant proposal for 90 minutes per day, M-F. The
contractor has a R01 due October 5th and another due December 5th.

C. Generative writing for one book reaching a minimum of 1000 new words
by Friday of each week. The contractor has a soft goal on adding 4000
words a month. The contractor will work on the book on the weekends.

D. Qualifying text includes: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Manuscripts, grant applications, books
\item Editorial reviews of manuscripts and grant proposals
\item Mind maps for planning manuscripts or grant applications

\item Any other activity that advances the writing project
\end{itemize}


E. Confirm achievement of A and B by sending an email with ``Done'' on
the subject line to the Mentor by 11:59 PM. Done on Friday's means that
the book writing is finished.

F. The contractor may not do the following during the writing blocks and
will restart if any interruptions occur. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Check e-mail
\item Surf the web
\item Listen to interview or news show videos on YouTube (music is okay if it is not distracting)
